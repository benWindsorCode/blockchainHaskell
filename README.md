# blockchainHaskell
This is an implementaiton of a very simple blockchain, inspired by ['This tutorial'](https://medium.com/@mycoralhealth/code-your-own-blockchain-in-less-than-200-lines-of-go-e296282bcffc). The project is more an exercise in learning to write useful code in Haskell than it is an exercise in writing a fully featured blockchain.

# Running
Given you have the Haskell Stack, run 
```
stack build
stack exec blockchainHaskell-exe
```
to execute the code, where you will see output of a test blockchain created.
